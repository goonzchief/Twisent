# Twisent
Twisent is a Python application that performs real-time sentiment analysis on live tweets using the Twitter API, natural language processing (NLP), and machine learning techniques. The program fetches live tweets, preprocesses the text, analyzes the sentiment using both VADER and TextBlob, and displays the results in a live-updating graph.
